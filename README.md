# John Conway's Game of Life

This is my version of Conway's game of life.

All cells are on a 100 x 100 plane

It is paused by default, you can unpause by pressing P

If you want to edit a Cell, either click or press space while hovering over a cell.

## Automaton Rules

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
